/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Module: slyEvaluate
 *
 * Defines several directives related to preventing evaluating watchers
 * on scopes under certain conditions.  Here's a list of the directives
 * and brief descriptions.  See down below for more details.
 *
 *  slyEvaluateOnlyWhen:  A directive that prevents updating / evaluating
 *      all bindings for the current element and its children unless
 *      the expression has changed values.  It currently assumes the
 *      expression evaluates to an object and detects changes only by
 *      a change in object reference.
 *
 *  slyAlwaysEvaluate: Can only be used in conjunction with the
 *      slyEvaluateOnlyWhen directive.  This directive will ensure that
 *      any expression that is being watched will always be evaluated
 *      if it contains the specified string (i.e., it will ignore whether
 *      or not the slyEvaluateOnlyWhen expression has changed.)  This
 *      is useful when you wish to check some expressions all the time.
 *
 *  slyPreventEvaluationWhenHidden:  Will only evaluate the bindings
 *      for the current element and its children if the current element
 *      is not hidden (detected by the element having the ng-hide CSS class.)
 *
 *  slyShow:  Will hide the element if the expression evaluates to false.
 *      Uses ng-hide to hide the element.  This is almost exactly the same
 *      as ngShow, but it has the advantage that it works better with
 *      slyPreventEvaluationWhenHidden by guaranteeing it will always evaluate
 *      its show expression to determine if it should or should not be hidden.

/**
 * Directive for preventing all bound expressions in the current element and its children
 * from being evaluated unless the specified expression evaluates to a different object.
 * Currently, the value assigned to the 'slyEvaluateOnlyWhen' must evaluate to an object.
 * Also, reference equality is used to determine if the expression has changed.
 * TODO: Make this more versatile, similar to $watch.  For now, this is all we need.
